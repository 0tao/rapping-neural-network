# Rapping-neural-network
I made this for my high school's programming club - which I'm the president/founder of.

It's a neural network that has been trained on rap songs, and can rearrange any lyrics you feed it into a song that rhymes and has a flow (to an extent).

For example: I could feed it the lyrics of around 10 rap songs from various artists and it would in essence, combine lines from all of the songs you feed it to make a new song. There's also another file that helps it actually rap the song on a beat with text to speech.





## Write song

Install (with python 2.x)

    pip install -U -r requirements.txt 
    
Download the trained nn "trained_net-420000" https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B-_m9VM1w1bKR3NTdVJRRDVCeE0&export=download

Fill "lyrics.txt" with rap lyrics of your choosing - the more the better - avoid putting things like "[bridge]" or "[intro]" in there - only put in actual lines from the song - and separate each line by a newline (press the 'enter' key, usually)

    python deeprap.py

deeprap.py will show you some of its processes, and once it terminates 'neural_rap.txt' will contain the song the neural network has composed. You no longer have to add the good verses it generates by hand - It can select good verses and write them to the file itself.
    
## Generate sound

    python speechtest.py 
    
beat.mp3 is the beat

# Let's hear something it made
Okay... Here's some lyrics that it made - excuse the vulgarities, the neural network wrote it and not me.

And here is the recording of "speechtest.py" using those lyrics.
